For extended regex you need to use - '-E ' option in grep - which stands for Extended POSIX Standards.

{m,n} - atleast m and at most n occurences of whatever
precedes. Only one of m,n is mandatory. Others can 
be left blank.


Example: Find the letters which are minimum 4 letters and maximum 6 letters.

$cat regex19.txt 
lion  
tiger
leopard
fox
kangaroo
bat
mouse
cuckoo
deer


$grep -E '^[a-z]{4,6}$' regex19.txt
lion
tiger
mouse
cuckoo
deer
