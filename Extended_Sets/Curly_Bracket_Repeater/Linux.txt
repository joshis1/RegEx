For extended regex you need to use - '-E ' option in grep - which stands for Extended POSIX Standards.

{m} - exactly 'm' occurences of whatever precedes.


Example: Find all three digit literals.

$cat regex18.txt 
834
519
4874
5
89
45687
25
645

$grep -E '^[0-9]{3}$' regex18.txt
834
519
645
