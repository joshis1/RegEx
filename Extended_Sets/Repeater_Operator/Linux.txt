For extended regex you need to use - '-E ' option in grep - which stands for Extended POSIX Standards.

+ means one or more occurrence.


Example: Find one a or more a between foo and bar for each line.

$cat regex22.txt 
fooaaaabar
fooabar
foobar
fooaabar
fooxxxbar
fooxbar


$grep -E 'fooa+bar' regex22.txt 
fooaaaabar
fooabar
fooaabar

Which of the following regular expressions can represent all of the strings 'a','aa' and 'aaa' , AND should exclude empty strings?

a+
