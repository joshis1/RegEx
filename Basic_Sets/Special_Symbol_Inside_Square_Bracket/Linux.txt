Special characters inside square brackets doesn't need backslash except - and ^ symbol?

- symbol inside square bracket is used to represent range.
^ symbol inside square bracket is used to represent not operator.


Example: 

$cat regex12.txt 
x#y
x:y
x.y
x&y
x%y


$grep 'x[#:.]y' regex12.txt 
x#y
x:y
x.y


$cat regex13.txt 
x#y
x:y
x^y  ------> Look we want to include this too. We need escape character inside bracket to mute its special meaning.
x&y
x%y


$grep 'x[#:\^]y' regex13.txt 
x#y
x:y
x^y


$cat regex14.txt 
x#y
x\y  -> escape character to include this.
x^y  -> escape character to include this.
x&y
x%y

$grep 'x[#\\\^]y' regex14.txt 
x#y
x\y
x^y
